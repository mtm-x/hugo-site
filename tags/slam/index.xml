Though I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, just getting selected from all the participants felt pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional finale took place at M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, which was an exciting experience competing alongside other talented teams from across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIM is basically a competition where engineering students get to work with AI and robotics for mobility applications. We had to build mobile robot prototypes using technologies like AI/ML, object recognition, sensors, computer vision, and obstacle avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
