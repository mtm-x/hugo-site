    title: About Me
    content: 'I''m passionate about the intersection of hardware and software, specializing
      in embedded systems, IoT devices, and edge AI applications. My journey in technology
      is driven by curiosity and the desire to create innovative solutions that bridge
      the digital and physical worlds.


      With expertise in Python, C, and various embedded platforms like Raspberry Pi,
      I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems. Whether it''s developing
      IoT sensors, creating automation systems, or exploring robotics with ROS2, I''m
      always excited to learn and experiment with new technologies.


      When I''m not coding, you''ll find me tinkering with hardware, exploring the
      latest in edge computing, or sharing my learning journey through blog posts
      and project documentation. I believe in continuous learning and open-source
      collaboration.'
