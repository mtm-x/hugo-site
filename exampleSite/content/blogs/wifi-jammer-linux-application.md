description: "A simple Linux application for WiFi access point jamming using network security techniques."
category: "Project"
---

Built a WiFi jammer application for Linux that can jam WiFi access points. This was a learning project to understand network security concepts and GUI Development.

The application targets WiFi access points and disrupts their normal operation. It taught me a lot about network protocols, wireless security, and how networks can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks.

## Key features

- Linux-based WiFi jamming functionality
- Easy GUI with Qt Framework

This project helped me understand the importance of network security and how to protect against such attacks. It's important to note this should only be used for educational purposes and on networks you own or have permission to test.
