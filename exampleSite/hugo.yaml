    title: About Me
    content: 'I''m an embedded systems and low-level programming enthusiast with a deep 
      passion for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Currently, I''m diving deep 
      into the Linux kernel and Linux device drivers, with the goal of contributing 
      to the Linux kernel in the future.


      My expertise spans across C/C++ for bare-metal and kernel-space programming, 
      Python for rapid prototyping, and the Qt framework for cross-platform application 
      development. I work extensively with embedded platforms, Linux kernel internals, 
      device driver development, and ROS2 for robotics applications. My commitment to 
      FOSS drives me to contribute to open-source projects and share knowledge with 
      the community.


      Whether I''m writing kernel modules, debugging device drivers, optimizing embedded 
      firmware, building IoT solutions, or developing desktop applications with Qt, 
      I''m constantly exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what''s 
      possible with code and hardware. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration 
      and continuous learning.'
