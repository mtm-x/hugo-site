Though I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, just getting selected from all the participants felt pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional finale took place at M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, which was an exciting experience competing alongside other talented teams from across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIM is basically a competition where engineering students get to work with AI and robotics for mobility applications. We had to build mobile robot prototypes using technologies like AI/ML, object recognition, sensors, computer vision, and obstacle avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First Steps with ROS2 and Robotics</title><link>/blogs/first-steps-ros2-robotics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blogs/first-steps-ros2-robotics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Diving into ROS2 has been an exciting challenge! Coming from embedded systems background, the distributed nature of ROS2 nodes was initially confusing but incredibly powerful once understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-ive-learned-so-far"&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node communication through topics and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URDF and XACRO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with Gazebo for simulation and debugging with foxglove and rviz2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic navigation and mapping concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently working on a simple autonomous navigation project using a simulated robot. The learning curve is steep but rewarding - every small milestone feels like a major achievement!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
