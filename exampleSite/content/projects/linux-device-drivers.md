My journey into Linux kernel programming and device driver development. Learning how the kernel works under the hood - writing kernel modules, device drivers, and exploring system calls, memory management, and debugging techniques.

Following the Pyjamabrah course taught by Google engineers Piyush Itankar and Mahmad Bharmal. The goal is to master kernel internals and contribute to the Linux kernel in the future.

All my practice code and learning exercises are documented in the repo below.

**Learning:** C for kernel space, Kernel APIs, Character/Block/Network drivers, Synchronization, Interrupt handling
