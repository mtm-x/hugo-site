Thrilled to announce that I achieved 3rd place in the Qt-athon 2024 competition! This global event organized by Qt Group brought together developers from around the world to showcase their Qt framework expertise.

The competition challenged participants to build innovative applications using Qt framework, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with cross-platform development. My project focused on creating a sophisticated GUI application that demonstrated both technical prowess and user experience design.

This achievement validates my expertise in Qt development and opens up new opportunities in the Qt ecosystem. The recognition from Qt Group is particularly meaningful as it comes from the creators of the framework themselves.

This experience has motivated me to continue contributing to the Qt community and exploring advanced framework capabilities.
