An AI-powered assistive system that helps people who are blind navigate and understand their surroundings. It detects objects in real-time, understands scenes, and provides audio feedback about what's around them.

The system uses computer vision and machine learning to identify objects and describe the environment through voice assistance, making everyday navigation safer and more independent for users.

**Tech stack:** AI, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Python, Deep Learning, Audio Processing
