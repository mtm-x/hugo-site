Project Eye is an AI-powered assistive system I developed to help people who are blind navigate and interact with their surroundings more independently. This project represents my commitment to using technology for social good and making AI accessible to those who need it most.

## The Vision

The goal was to create an intelligent system that could serve as digital eyes for visually impaired individuals, helping them understand their environment and navigate safely through the world.

## Project Overview

Project Eye uses advanced computer vision and AI technologies to analyze the user's surroundings in real-time and provide audio feedback about objects, obstacles, people, and important environmental information.

## Key Features Being Developed

- Real-time object detection and recognition
- Obstacle detection and path navigation assistance
- Text reading capabilities for signs and documents
- Person recognition and tracking
- Distance estimation for detected objects
- Audio feedback system for hands-free interaction

## Technical Implementation

- **Computer Vision**: Advanced object detection algorithms
- **AI/ML**: Machine learning models for scene understanding
- **Audio Processing**: Text-to-speech for user feedback
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for low-latency response
- **Accessibility Design**: Built with accessibility principles in mind

## Impact and Purpose

This project addresses a real need in the accessibility space. By leveraging AI and computer vision, Project Eye aims to provide greater independence and confidence to visually impaired users in their daily activities.

## What I'm Learning

Working on Project Eye has deepened my understanding of computer vision, accessibility design principles, and the importance of inclusive technology. It's also taught me about the challenges of real-time AI processing and user experience design for assistive technologies.

This project continues to evolve as I learn more about the needs of the visually impaired community and advance my skills in AI and computer vision technologies.
