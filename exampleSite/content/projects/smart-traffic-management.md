This project uses deep learning to detect ambulances in real-time and automatically controls traffic lights to clear their path. Built for the TechForSociety hackathon by Siemens and NASSCOM Foundation.

The system runs on a Raspberry Pi and uses YOLO for computer vision. When it spots an ambulance, it immediately adjusts nearby traffic signals to create a priority lane - helping save lives by getting emergency vehicles to hospitals faster.

**Tech stack:** Python, IoT, Deep Learning (YOLO), Raspberry Pi, QML, Computer Vision
