Droid Debloat is a desktop application I built using the Qt Framework to help users remove unwanted system apps (bloatware) from their Android devices. This project was born out of my own frustration with the amount of pre-installed apps that come with Android devices and can't be easily removed through normal means.

## The Problem

Most Android devices come pre-loaded with numerous system apps that users might not want or need. These apps often can't be uninstalled through the regular interface, leading to cluttered devices and wasted storage space.

## My Solution

I created a user-friendly desktop application that uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) commands to safely remove these unwanted system applications. The Qt Framework provided the perfect foundation for creating a clean, intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- Clean Qt-based graphical user interface
- Safe removal of Android system applications
- ADB integration for device communication
- User-friendly design with clear instructions
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Technical Implementation

- Qt Framework for the desktop application interface
- C++ for core application logic
- ADB command integration for Android device communication
- Safe app removal procedures to prevent system damage

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about desktop application development with Qt, Android system architecture, and ADB protocols. It also reinforced the importance of creating tools that solve real-world problems that I and others face daily.

The application has been helpful for cleaning up personal devices and understanding how Android package management works at a deeper level. It's satisfying to create a tool that makes device management more accessible to regular users.
