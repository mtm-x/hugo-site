Created a Python script version of my WiFi jammer project. This was part of exploring different programming approaches to network security tools.

The Python version offers:

- Clean, readable code structure
- CLI based and more interactive and beautiful 

Working with Python was fun and easy.

This project reinforced my understanding of both Python programming. It's designed purely for educational use and understanding how wireless networks operate.
