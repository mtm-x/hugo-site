Recently started diving into C++ by following The Cherno's YouTube series.

The Cherno's teaching style is really clear and practical. He breaks down complex concepts into digestible parts, which makes learning much easier.

## What I'm covering

- Basic syntax and language fundamentals
- Memory management and pointers
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Understanding how C++ works under the hood

Still early in my C++ journey, but I'm already seeing how powerful the language is for system-level programming. Planning to apply this knowledge to future embedded projects and potentially game development down the line.

The series is well-structured and perfect for someone like me who wants to understand not just the "how" but also the "why" behind C++ concepts.
