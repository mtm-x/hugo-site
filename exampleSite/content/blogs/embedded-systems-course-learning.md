Currently taking an embedded systems course from Pyjamabrah, taught by Piyush Itankar and Mahmad Bharmal who both work at Google. It's been a solid learning experience so far.

The course covers the fundamentals you need for embedded systems development, which is exactly what I was looking for.

## Progress so far

**C Programming - Completed**

Just finished the C fundamentals section and got my certification. The low-level programming concepts are starting to click, which feels great.

## Currently working on

- C Pointers - Getting into memory management and pointer arithmetic
- Python - Learning how to use it for embedded applications
- AArch64 Architecture - ARM 64-bit processor stuff
- FPGA Development - Hardware description and programmable logic

Having instructors from Google is pretty cool because they bring real industry perspective. The course builds up from basics to practical implementation, which works well for me.

The C certification was a good milestone. Now diving into pointers, which is where things get interesting. The combination of all these topics should give me a solid foundation for embedded projects.
