Wrote a shell script version of the WiFi jammer to explore bash scripting and system-level network operations. This was interesting because it showed how much you can accomplish with simple shell commands.

## What the shell script taught me

- Initial script to apply my shell scripting knowledge
- Linux networking tools and utilities

It's fascinating how different tools can achieve similar results. The shell script version is probably the most lightweight of all my WiFi jammer implementations, requiring minimal dependencies and running efficiently on any Linux system.

This project improved my Linux system administration skills and deepened my understanding of how network tools work at the command line level.
