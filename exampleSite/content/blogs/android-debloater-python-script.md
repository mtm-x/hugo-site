description: "A Python script to remove system apps from Android devices using ADB commands and automation."
category: "Project"
---

Developed a Python script that automates the removal of system apps from Android devices. This was born out of frustration with bloatware on Android phones and wanting to clean them up programmatically.

The script uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to communicate with Android devices and remove unwanted system applications that can't normally be uninstalled through the regular interface.

This project taught me about ADB protocol, and how to build useful automation tools. It also reinforced my Python skills, especially working with subprocess management and command-line tools.

The script has been helpful for cleaning up personal devices and understanding how Android package management works under the hood.
