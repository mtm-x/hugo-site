Though I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, just getting selected from all the participants felt pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional finale took place at M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, which was an exciting experience competing alongside other talented teams from across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIM is basically a competition where engineering students get to work with AI and robotics for mobility applications. We had to build mobile robot prototypes using technologies like AI/ML, object recognition, sensors, computer vision, and obstacle avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Project Eye - AI-Powered Assistive System</title><link>https://thamaraimanalan.tech/blogs/project-eye-ai-assistive-system/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thamaraimanalan.tech/blogs/project-eye-ai-assistive-system/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Project Eye is an AI-powered assistive system I developed to help people who are blind navigate and interact with their surroundings more independently. This project represents my commitment to using technology for social good and making AI accessible to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal was to create an intelligent system that could serve as digital eyes for visually impaired individuals, helping them understand their environment and navigate safely through the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
