A network security tool for Linux that detects and jams WiFi access points. Originally built with Qt and Python, now being ported to QML and C++ for better performance.

The app scans nearby WiFi networks and can jam specific access points through a clean Qt GUI. Currently migrating to C++ for improved efficiency, better UI responsiveness, and cleaner code.

*For educational and security testing purposes only*

**Tech stack:** Qt Framework, QML, C++, Python, Linux networking
