Diving into ROS2 has been an exciting challenge! Coming from embedded systems background, the distributed nature of ROS2 nodes was initially confusing but incredibly powerful once understood.

## What I've learned so far

- Node communication through topics and services
- URDF and XACRO
- Integration with Gazebo for simulation and debugging with foxglove and rviz2
- Basic navigation and mapping concepts

Currently working on a simple autonomous navigation project using a simulated robot. The learning curve is steep but rewarding - every small milestone feels like a major achievement!
